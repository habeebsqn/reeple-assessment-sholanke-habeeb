This is my reeple assessment app project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

it's important you follow the instructions for setting up a react native projects thus i left the initial configuration instructions

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding also have the latest version of andriod studio for better project bootstrapping

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start clone the project to your pc to have the project folder then open in andriod studio or vscode make to wait for the java compilation to complete.
To install all dependencies and libraries , run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone < habeebsqn/reeple-assessment-habeeb-sholanke >


2. Install dependencies:

   npm install


3. Start the application:

   npm start


```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
